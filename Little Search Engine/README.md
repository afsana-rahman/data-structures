# Project 4: Little Search Engine

**PLEASE NOTE:** I recently redid this project (at time of upload to Github). This version was not submitted/tested for a grade. I started with the same template that the original project was given.

This project provided practice on using HashMaps.

Starter code was provided for the project. My contribution only includes edits to the functions in the LittleSearchEngine.java file.
